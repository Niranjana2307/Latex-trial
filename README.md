# **Solution - Introduction to Computer Science I**

### _New SME Trial Task_ 

### Author: Niranjana Srinivasa Ragavan


**Start time**: Monday 11 am PST 

**End time**: Monday 4.50 pm PST

## **Tools and packages used:** LATEX, Google Colab, and PythonTex

## **Explanation of files**

1. assignment.tex → contains the explanations of the questions provided
2. assignment.ipynb → contains the accompanying code used for explanation

## Structure of the explanations

I wrote the explanations with the given assumption of prerequisite knowledge. I followed the pattern of the question samples provided in the document and added the following things additionally to explain the solution.

1. Scope of the variables
2. Bytecode (only for one example, to explain the closures, and how list comprehension is similar to functions, rather than the for loop)
3. I have used the equivalent for loop to explain the stepwise executions


It has become prevalent to use AI tools for writing assignments and other writing projects, and sometimes detection tools also flag the human written text as AI. To ensure transparency, I used git version control and latex for writing this assignment, to track my history of modifications and commits.
